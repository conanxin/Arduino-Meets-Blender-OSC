This project demonstrates how to use the Arduino to
control items in Blenders Game Engine via the OSC protocol.
It was initially created for real time digital puppetry.
But it can be used as a starting example for any project that needs
to communicate with Blender's GameEngine via the OSC (Open Sound Control) protocol.

Since it uses the OSC protocol this project also demonstrates 
how any OSC enabled app can send data to the Blender GameEngine.


REQUIRMENTS

oscP5 library by Andreas Schlegel (included)
http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/index.html

Python SimpleOSC  (included)
SimpleOSC is a simple API for the Open Sound Control for Python 
by Daniel Holth, Clinton McChesney 

You'll need the Arduino IDE, Processing IDE and Blender to
run this project. 

You will also need an Arduino board, 3 wires, a potentiometer, breadboard and a USB cable. 

PROCESS

0 Download Alpha Release

1 Hardware
Basically, one Arduino and one 3 pin potentiometer, 3 wires and the USB
cord make up the demo circuit. The middle pin of the potentiometer 
the middle pin is wired to the Analog 3 INPUT pin of the Arduino. 
The outside pins are wired to 5 Volt and GND. 
Values you read from this pin will return the full range of levels.
( 0 to 1023, 0 to 5 Volts)

You'll have to hook up the Arduino and select the proper Arduino device
name. On Mac OS X you can find that in /dev/ looking for something like
"/dev/tty.usbserial-A7006Rjr" after you connect the Arduino up.
You'll need to hard code that into the processing sketch so take note.

Upload the code from arduino_code/ folder to the board.

2 Processing
You need to install the oscP5 by andreas schlegel
(http://www.sojamo.de/oscP5) in processing. 
You go into the Processing App (Right click Show Package Contents) 
It's in Contents/Resources/Java/libraries.
Place the oscP5 folder in there, restart processing.
You should be able to import oscP5.*;

Change the line in oscarduino.pde to match your Arduino dev file.
String portname = "/dev/WHATEVER_YOUR_SERIAL_DEVICE_NAME";  You can
find out what it is by opening Terminal.app and cd /dev then ls and search
for something that starts with tty.YattaYatta

Note the varibles TO_PORT and FROM_PORT in the oscarduino.pde file. 
The Blender code is going to be listening on a PORT. PORT should match
the TO_PORT varible in the processing sketch.

You'll also need to change HOST varible to match your localhost.
You can open the Terminal.app and type in ifconfig to find that information.
It should be up near the top around eth0. Goto System Preferences and then to Network.
This will also show you the IP Address of your local computer.


3 This demo was created with Blender 2.49b on a Mac OS X 10.6 Intel Machine.
Inside of the blender_code/ folder you'll find a demo blend file.
It should have the file arduino_to_blender.py already loaded inside.
In tha text file you will need to match the PORT to the TO_PORT from
the processing sketch. 

The OSC SimpleOSC python module is in the same directory as the .blend file so you shouldn't have to install it inside blender. It's recommened that you install OSC in blender (place inside scripts/) or open all the files from blender_code/OSC into the blend file if you wish to make your blend file portable or standalone later.

You'll need to adjust:

# Check that you don't have a firewall blocking ports on your computer
# Must match part Processing is sending OSC message with
PORT = 2014  # ;) 

# Most be set to same IP as localhost
HOST = "10.0.0.3"

in the arduino_to_blender.py text file. 

4 Test Run

Once all that is done you should be able to run the processing example
and then Press P in Blender's View3D window to run the example in the
GameEngine.

Try turning the control knob. You should see the gauge move.

DEVELOPMENT NOTES

Try using higher port numbers if the project doesn't work.
And make sure you don't have any firewall blocking ports. 
Also check the HOST matches your localhost IP. 

The processing sketch has a test mode in case you suspect somethings
wrong with your Arduino. Set TEST = true; if you want to test send
data to Blender by moving the mouse in your sketch.
